How to use this:
1.  Create a new stack with `struct stack *stack = stack_new(el_size, print)`
    The arguments are:
     a) el_size -- size of element pointer ex: sizeof(struct elem *)
     b) print -- print function of signature `void print(void *elem)`
        which prints an element of the stack
    Returns the pointer to new stack

2.  To push to stack,  `stack->methods->push(stack, elem)`
    note: elem is pointer to element NOT element itself

3.  To pop from stack, `struct elem *elem = stack->methods->pop(stack)`
        Returns pointer to popped element

4.  To print the elements, `stack->methods->print(stack)`
        Prints elements from bottom to top

5.  To delete stack, `stack_remove(stack)`
